Goal: To observe the easiest ways in which a shape (a protein) can deform. 

Proteins aren't static, and their motion is often grounded in functional requirement. 
For example, myosin's lever arm swinging is how muscles contract. 
Simulating protein motion with full physics (molecular dynamics) is incredibly computationally expensive. 
An anisotropic network model is a shortcut that answers the question of "what is the easiest way in which this shape(protein) can deform?"
Imagine a protein as a network of balls, which are the alpha carbon atoms (one per residue). 
These balls are connected by springs. 

If two atoms are closer than some cutoff distance, connect them with a spring 
Assume all springs have the same stiffness
The most simple form of this model considers no chemistry, no electrostatics, no water. 

It works under the assumption that a protein's architecture constrains motion. 
A long floppy loop will move more than a tightly packed core, regardless of atomic information. 

Math:

When you displace atoms from equilibrium positions, the springs push back. 
The Hessian matrix encodes the information of how much atom j feels a push in atom i. 
For N atoms we have 3N coordinates (x, y, z). So the Hessian is a 3Nx3N matrix. 

we can calculate -GAMMA * np.outer(d_vec, d_vec) / dist_sq

This finds the force between atoms i and j acting along the line that connects them 
(outer(d_vec, d_vec)). 

When we solve for the eigenvalues and the eigenvectors of the hessian, we are essentially asking what the natural 
vibration patterns of the spring network are. 

Individual eigenvalues quantify the stiffness of this motion. Eigenvectors represent the actual displacement pattern, in 3N dimensional vectors.
